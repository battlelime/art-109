I WANT YOU TO LOOK EVEN CLOSER! it's very important that you can see me...  skin isn’t mine anymore. It peels, it stretches, it laughs when I’m not looking. I tried to staple it back, but the holes only made more mouths, and they whisper in voices I don’t recognize. They tell me things, terrible things, things that sound like music if you tilt your head just right. The walls are listening. The floor is breathing. I saw a shadow today, but it wasn’t mine—it reached for me, fingers too long, joints bending the wrong way, and when I blinked, it was closer. I can hear it now. In the vents. In my teeth. In the spaces between the seconds where the world flickers and something else peers through. It wants in. It wants out. But I don’t know which of us is trapped anymore.</p>
