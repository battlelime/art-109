        <p>Where it all started was with video games. My first ever memories of being alive were memories of me playing
          video games with my father in the corner of his room; we would be playing on a PlayStation 2 connected to a big
          and heavy gray box tv. I remember being completely enthralled by the sheer scale of the video games I played. The
          colors, the setting, the conversations, the characters; each game had something to tell, something to show. Each
          with their own unique rules and limitations. It had always stunned me since that video games were so potent in
          delivering so many different ideas, themes, messages, and styles. Video games as a medium, seemed endless for
          unlimited potential. It is as if video games were water and could take on any shape for form that was to be
          presented. I had learned so much from all my games, and now recognize later as an adult that I take on a lot of my
          personality, traits, and behaviors from the games I played. I owe a lot of gratitude to games, as I think they
          help make a foundation of my identity.</p>
